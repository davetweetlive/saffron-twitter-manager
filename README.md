# Twitter-Statics

This Project is under development to keep you free from 



Often we login to third party applications using Twitter which gives us this as their terms and conditions 

    - See Tweets from your timeline (including protected Tweets) as well as your Lists and collections.
    - See your Twitter profile information and account settings.
    - See accounts you follow, mute, and block.
    - Follow and unfollow accounts for you.
    - Update your profile and account settings.
    - Post and delete Tweets for you, and engage with Tweets posted by others 
    - Create, manage, and delete Lists and collections for you.
    - Mute, block, and report accounts for you.

And ofcourse I don't want someone else doing nonsense with my Twitter account. Hence the project is under development and the prototype will be lunched soon.
